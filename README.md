## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samrathreddy/Unipay.git
cd Unipay
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### 3. Create a .env File

#### In the server directory, create a file named .env and add the following variables:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
MONGO_URL=your_mongo_connection_string

RAZORPAY_API_KEY=your_razorpay_api_key
RAZORPAY_API_SECRET=your_razorpay_api_secret

email=your_email
emailPass=your_email_password

DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID=your_admin_channel_id
VERIFIED_CHANNEL_ID=your_verified_channel_id
REJECTED_CHANNEL_ID=your_rejected_channel_id
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

#### 4.Running the Application

#### Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and start the React development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Backend

Navigate to the client directory and start the Express server with nodemon:

```bash
cd server
npm run start
```

This will start the server on http://localhost:8000 and restart it automatically if there are any changes to the code.
